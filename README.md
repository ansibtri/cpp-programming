C++ is a high-level programming language created by [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup) in 1974. It is widely used for developing software applications. It was originally developed as an extenstion to the C Programming language and adds features such as OOP, templates and exception handling.

Here are the key principles and concepts of OOPs:

1. Objects: Objects are instances of classes that represent real-world entities or concepts. They encapsulate data (attributes or properties) and behavior (methods or functions) into a single entity. Objects interact with each other by sending messages and invoking methods.

2. Classes: Classes are the blueprint or template for creating objects. They define the structure, behavior, and initial state of objects. A class encapsulates data members (attributes) and member functions (methods) that operate on those data members.

3. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and the methods that manipulate that data within a single unit (i.e., a class). It hides the internal details of an object and exposes only the necessary interfaces, allowing for data protection and abstraction. Encapsulation enhances data security and code maintainability.

4. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, called the base class or superclass. The derived class or subclass inherits the characteristics of the base class and can add additional features or override existing ones. Inheritance promotes code reuse, modularity, and extensibility.

5. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables a single interface to be used to represent objects of different types. Polymorphism can be achieved through function overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and function overriding (runtime polymorphism).

6. Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on representing essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details. It provides a simplified view of complex systems. Abstract classes and interfaces define common structure and behavior without providing implementation details. Objects are then created based on these abstractions.

7. Modularity: Modularity is the practice of breaking down a program into smaller, self-contained modules or classes. Each module has a well-defined purpose, encapsulates related data and behavior, and communicates with other modules through well-defined interfaces. Modularity promotes code reusability, maintainability, and flexibility.

OOPs allows developers to design software in a more organized and intuitive manner by modeling real-world entities and their interactions. It facilitates code reuse, reduces code complexity, and improves software development productivity.
