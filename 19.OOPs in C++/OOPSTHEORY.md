# Object Oriented Programming in C++

### Why OOPs?
1. C++ language was designed with the main intention ofadding object-oriented features to C language
2. As the size of the program increases, readability, maintainability and bug-free nature of programs decreases.
3. This was the the major problem with languages like C which relied upon functions or procedures(hence the name procedural programming language)
4. As a result, the possibility of not addressing the problem in a effective manner was high.
5. Also, as data was almost neglected data security was easily compromised.
6. Using classes solves this modelling program as a real world scenario.


### Differences between POP and OOPs
|  S.No  |    POP     |      OOPs      |
|--------|------------|----------------|
|   1.   | Consists of writing as set of instructions for the computer to follow. | Works on the concept of classes and objects|
|   2.   | Main focus is on functions and not on flow of data. | A class is a template to create objects. |
|   3.   | Functions can either use local or global data. | Treats data as a critical element. |
|   4.   | Data moves openly from function to function. | Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and function around the objects. |

### Basic Concepts in OOPs
* __Classes:__ Basic template for creating objects
* __Objects:__ Basic run time-entities
* __Data Abstraction & Encapsulation:__ Wrapping data functions into single unit
* __Inheritance:__ Properties of one class can be inherited into others
* __Polymorphism:__ ability to take more than one forms
* __Late Binding/Dynamic Binding:__ code which will execute is not known until the program
* __Message Passing:__ __Object.message(Information)__ call format

### Benefits of OOPs

* Better code reusability using objects and inheritance
* Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems
* Multiple objects can co-exist without any intereference
* Software complexity can be easily managed
