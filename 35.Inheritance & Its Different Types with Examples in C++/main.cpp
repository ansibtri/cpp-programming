// Inheritance in C++ :: Overview
// -->> Reusability is a very important feature of OOPs
// -->> In C++ we can resuse a class and add additional features to it.
// -->> Reusing classes saves time and money 
// -->> Reusing already tested and debugged class will save a lot of effort of developing and debugging the same thing again. 

// Why is Inheritance in C++
// -->> The concept of Reusability in C++ is supported using inheritance
// -->> We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inheriting from it.
// -->> The existing class is called as the Base Class
// -->> The new class which is inherited is called as the Derived Class
// -->> Reusing classes saves time and money

// -->> There are different types of inheritance in C++
// -->> ==>Single Inheritance
// -->> ==>Mutiple Inheritance
// -->> ==>Hierarchical Inheritance
// -->> ==>Multilevel Inheritance
// -->> ==>Hybrid Inheritance

// -->> Single Inheritance in C++
// -->> ==> A derived class with only one Base class

// -->> Multiple Inheritance in C++
// -->> ==> A derived class with more than one Base Class

// -->> Hierarchical Inheritance in C++
// -->> ==> Several derived classes from a Single Base Class

// -->> Multilevel Inheritance in C++
// -->> ==> Deriving a class from already derived class

// -->> Hybrid Inheritance in C++
// -->> ==> Hybrid Inheritance is a combination of multiple inhreitance and multilevel inheritance
// -->> ==> A class is derived from two classes as in multiple inheritance
// -->> ==> However, one of the parent classes is not a base class.
